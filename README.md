👋 Hi, I’m Aarav
(Yes, this is my portfolio. No, it’s not another TODO app.)
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where code ships, side-projects escape into the wild, and “just one more feature” is a lifestyle choice.
I’m a full-stack software engineer who likes building things that actually do stuff, preferably at scale, preferably with AI somewhere in the loop, and preferably without breaking production (too often).

🚀 What I’m About


🧠 I build AI-powered, product-first systems


🛠️ I enjoy owning problems end-to-end: frontend → backend → deployment → “why is this alert firing at 3am”


📈 I care about real users, not demo only code


🎭 Occasionally I do drama. On stage. With humans. Long story.



🧩 Things I’ve Built (The Non-Boring Version)
📊 Signalist
An AI-powered stock analytics platform that tracks 5,000+ stocks, sends alerts, generates daily market digests, and pretends to be calm during earnings season.

Real-time data, event-driven workflows, auth, charts, emails, the whole startup starter pack.


🧘 YouTube Focus Mode (Chrome Extension)
Because productivity dies the moment Shorts autoplay.


Blocks distractions


Has strictness levels (yes, strict)


Runs fully client-side : no creepy tracking


50+ daily users. Thousands of saved brain cells.

🌐 Pagemint
An AI website generator that turns prompts into actual, usable websites.


Semantic layouts


Notion-style editor


Drag, drop, deploy


Basically: “vibes → website” pipeline.

🧠 How I Think (This Matters More Than My Tech Stack)


I don’t just write code ,  I design systems


I optimize for clarity, scalability, and future-me


I believe architecture decisions matter more than frameworks


I like trade-offs. I hate magic.



🛠️ Tech I’m Fluent In
Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C++, SQL
Frontend: React, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
Backend: Node.js, Express, FastAPI, REST, OAuth
Infra & Tools: Git, Vercel, CI/CD, Postman, Inngest
Bonus: Prompt engineering that actually works
(Yes, I Google things. No, that’s not a weakness.)

🧪 Background XP


Research intern working on AI/NLP & computational poetics


Processed 10k+ samples, built models, chased accuracy, questioned reality


Learned how to blend theory with shipping



🏁 Why This Portfolio Exists


To show how I think, not just what I know


To prove I can ship real products, not just pass interviews


To signal that I care about engineering + product + impact


If you’re looking for:


Someone who can build fast without breaking fundamentals


Someone who understands users and systems


Someone who treats side-projects like startups


We should probably talk.
